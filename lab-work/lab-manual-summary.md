# ðŸ§ª C. elegans Laboratory Manual Summary

I designed and wrote this manual for C. elegans laboratory research Palm Beach Atlantic University, covering essential information and laboratory techniques for individuals working with this model organism. I am the first to use this model organism at my university; therefore, my goal in developing this manual was to fill a need for understanding and subsequent pilot testing of this model in our laboratories.
