## Summary

This scoping review examines current evidence linking glyphosate exposure to neurodegenerative diseases. A total of 40+ studies were reviewed with a focus on laboratory animal and cellular models as well as human epidemiological studies.

## Highlights

- Found recurring associations between glyphosate and neuroinflammation
- Discussed blood-brain barrier permeability and oxidative stress mechanisms
- Discovered evidence for the correlation between glyphosate and neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, seizures, and autism spectrum disorder)

## Abstract
  
Chemically engineered agricultural products such as pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides, although used considerably for both industrialized and personal agricultural use, have recently been associated with a number of serious human health disorders. This rapid literature review aims to accumulate and analyze research from the last ten years, focusing specifically on the effects of exposure to glyphosate-based herbicide products such as Roundup as associated with the formation of various neurological disorders. Specifically, this review focuses on laboratory research using animal models or human cell cultures as well as human population-based epidemiological studies. It associates exposure to glyphosate or glyphosate-based products with the formation or exacerbation of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, seizures, and autism spectrum disorder. In addition, it examines the correlation between the gut-brain axis, exposure to glyphosate, and neurodegeneration.
